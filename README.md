Custom Partmodule designed to consume a ressource according to the current throttle of the ModuleEnginesFX module of the part.
Implements a thrustCurve feature, as well as a consumptionCurve that changes the consumed ressource's consumption rate depending on how much of that ressource there is.
Now also has configurable fuel bar colors for compatibility with custom HUD mods (though it has to manually be added, doesn't have any patch to automatically add it, and not going to bother with it currently. Will be up to whoever uses the module to implement that for now if they want.
